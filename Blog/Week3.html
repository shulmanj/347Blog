<h1>CSS Animations</h1>
<body>

    <p>
        I know that CSS can do a lot more than just style code, I just didn't know how much more it could really do.
        I decided to explore what I could do, without JavaScript being involved because quite honestly, I don't really
        know much JavaScript yet. I came across this cool animation that makes text on the screen look like it is being
        typed by a typewriter, where one character is being displayed at a time, along with a blinking cursor. 
    </p>

    <div class="animation">
        <h1>This is my week 3 blog.</h1>
    </div>

    <p>
        As you can see, this simple animation can add style and uniqueness to a web page. If your goal is to draw readers in,
        demonstrate animations, or promote your typewriter selling small-business, this animation will accomplish all of the above.
    </p>

    <p>
        The code for this animation is not too complicated. It involves text formatting for the text that appears on the screen,
        an animation aspect for the blinking cursor, and an animation aspect for the text appearing as if it's being typed.
    </p>

    <pre id="code">
    .animation h1 {
    font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
    color: rgb(13, 17, 221);
    overflow: hidden;
    border-right: .15em solid rgb(13, 103, 221); 
    white-space: nowrap; 
    margin: 0 auto; 
    letter-spacing: .15em; 
    text-align: center;
    animation: 
        typing 3.5s steps(40, end),
        blink-caret 1s step-end infinite;
    }</pre>

    <p>
        Here, the font family and color is set. The other attributes are to ensure that the rest of the text stays hidden until the 
        cursor reveals it, and to make sure the text stays on one line. The animation section handles the timing of the animation: 
        it will take 3.5 seconds for the animation to run, and the cursor will blink once every second and continue infinitely even 
        after the animation finishes.
    </p>

    <pre id="code">
    @keyframes typing {
        from { width: 0 }
        to { width: 100% }
    }</pre>

    <p>
        This code controls the typing effect. It sets the width that the text starts at to the width that the text ends at. In this case,
        I want the text to start at width 0 so that it is hidden, and end at width 100% so that it fills the entire area.
    </p>

    <pre id="code">
    @keyframes blink-caret {
        from, to { border-color: transparent }
        50% { border-color: rgb(221, 13, 13); }
    }</pre>

    <p>
        This last bit of code controls the cursor. It defines timing as well as the color of the cursor.
    </p>

    <p>
        Coding this animation in CSS has shown me that there is much more possibility with HTML and CSS alone than I had previously thought.
        I am excited to continue learning new things and growing my bank of CSS tricks.
