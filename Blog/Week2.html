    <h1>Java vs JavaScript</h1>
    <body>
        <p>
            Although the names sound very similar, the word "Java" is the only thing these two languages have in common.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1990, a developer named Brendan Eich developed a programming language in just 10 days that could instruct 
            the computer on how to interact with the user after receiving user input. Eich, a developer at Netscape, worked
             for one of the to most popular web browsers at the time, alongside Internet Explorer. Eich's language was integrated 
             directly into Netscape's Navigator and it was names "Livescript".
        </p>
        <p>
            The term "Livescript" meant that the browser was interpreting the commands of the user automatically, without the need to 
            compile and without the need of an external plug-in. Around the same time, another programming language was being developed 
            called Java. It was gaining more and more popularity even though it required an additional plug-in in order for it to function. 
            Netscape saw this other language gaining popularity and decided to change the name of its programming language to "JavaScript".
        </p>
        <p>
            Java, developed by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems took a little bit longer than 10 days to develop; 4 years. It was first 
            released in 1995, and several versions have been released since then. The internet today is covered in Java-run applications 
            and programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            Java and JavaScript are entirely two different progamming languages intended for different uses. Java is used in a wide range of 
            places from credit card programming, Android apps, and the creation of dektop applications. On the other hand, JavaScript is mainly 
            used to make web pages more interactive and appealing. For example, JavaScript can be used to add animations on web pages with HTML. 
            A few other examples include:
            <ul>
                <li>Java code must be compiled</li>
                <li>JavaScript code is only run on a web browser</li>
                <li>Java is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Language while JavaScript is an OOP scripting language</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Code Differences</h2>

        <h3>Java</h3>
        <pre id="code">
        public static void main (String[] args) {
            System.out.print("Hello World!");
        }</pre>

        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <pre id="code">
        console.log("Hello World!");</pre>
