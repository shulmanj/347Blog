    <h1>Final Blog Post</h1>

    <p>
        I really enjoyed this semester of CS347. Coming in, I had already known a little bit of HTML and CSS, but not
        more than enough to just make a simple webpage. Throuhgout the semester, I have learned things that have helped
        me in job interviews and will be useful for the rest of my career.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I were to teach this class, I don't really think there's too much that I would do differently. I think the 
        most beneficial thing I would do is to post the solutions to the labs after they're due. There's been a few 
        times this semester that if I had the lab solution I would have been able to complete an assignment with less 
        difficulty. 
    </p>

        I would have structured the course almost exactly the same as it was. Having the opportunity to read the book,
        follow along, and do examples before we talked about it in class was super helpful. I do wish that we were able 
        to spend a little bit more time on JavaScript, React, and more full-stack type things. I understand that that 
        wasn't necessarily possible because not everybody came into the class with the same required knowledge of basic
        HTML and CSS needed to develop full-stack applications. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The in-class labs were awesome. It was nice to be able to put my skills to use almost immediately after learning 
        them. It was also nice that they were completion-based, so if I was stuck or wasn't able to finish the lab in 
        class my grade didn't necessarily suffer. I did appreciate the fact that there were no exams. That took a lot
        of stress off of me because coming in, I was worried that this would be an exam-heavy class. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I think that the online book helped me learn the material of the class the most. It was structured in a way that 
        examples were embedded and I was able to write code in the book itself. It was also nice that for the most part, 
        the book reading and examples were directly related to the projects. I never felt like I was ever too stuck 
        on a project because the book most likely had the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, I really enjoyed this course. I liked the way it was structured and the way it was taught.
